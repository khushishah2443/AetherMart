## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional e-commerce systems often face challenges such as:

- Rigid relational schemas that struggle with unstructured data
- Inefficient keyword-based search with poor relevance
- Limited analytics readiness for downstream insights
- Scalability bottlenecks as data volume grows

AetherMart addresses these issues by combining structured data engineering with AI-powered retrieval and scalable system design.
